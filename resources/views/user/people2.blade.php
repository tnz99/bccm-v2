The initiative, known as Tendrel, involved all 82,000 households in the country and 26,000 trees planted by volunteers. Each sapling carries a prayer and wish for the prince's health and wisdom. Bhutan's deep connection with trees is rooted in Buddhism, where trees are seen as providers of life. In 2015, Bhutan set a Guinness World Record by planting nearly 50,000 trees in just one hour.</div>

                    In the higher elevations of Bhutan, particularly in places like Laya and Sakteng, nomads and highlanders are grappling with the impacts of climate change. Traditionally, highlanders would migrate to lower altitudes during harsh winters, seeking refuge in places like Punakha. However, climate change has disrupted this pattern, forcing nomads to frequently move in search of pastureland and water for their yaks and cattle. This shift in migration patterns is explored in the documentary "Climate Change and its Impacts on Mountain Pastern Among Highlanders." The film, funded by BMF's Climate Change Reporting Grant, sheds light on how climate change is altering life in Sakteng, with testimonies from village leaders and nomads who have experienced these changes for over 30 years. Despite being among the most vulnerable to climate impacts, these mountain communities endure the threats they did not cause, emphasizing the need for awareness and support.

From using energy-efficient appliances to practicing mindful consumption, the people of Bhutan understand that small, everyday choices collectively contribute to a carbon-neutral lifestyle. Moreover, communities actively engage in tree planting initiatives, turning barren areas into green spaces that act as carbon sinks and contribute to overall environmental health.

                    Jamyang, an actor, filmmaker, and environmental advocate, started a campaign in Bhutan to raise awareness about climate change. He visited schools, collected letters, and covered 15 dzongkhags. Due to fund constraints, he couldn't cover all 20 dzongkhags or get approval to visit some schools. Jamyang's campaign aimed to spread three key messages: plant trees and take care of them, transition to renewable energy, and include climate studies in the school curriculum. He used an electric car and a small team to film the campaign on mobile phones.

His commitment is extraordinary; with each step, he carries saplings and purpose. Sonam's efforts have transformed neglected spaces into thriving green havens. Over his lifetime, he planted 100,000 trees, a testament to his unwavering dedication.

Sonam embodies Bhutan's dedication to preserving its natural heritage. The constitutional mandate, requiring 60% forest cover, is a way of life embraced by individuals like him. His remarkable story symbolizes Bhutanese commitment to a green and sustainable future.
